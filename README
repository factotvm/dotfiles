Daniel Thompson's configuration - A work in progress

This is my configuration, which I require to run on Ubuntu, Mac OS X,
and the Emacs Shell Mode. It is a work in progress, and please be
warned that my ops chops aren't all that.

Inspiration
===========

https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles - If you're looking for a great
project to fork, head over there. I am heavily influenced by the

so that I learn by doing.
